This is a new version of the X10 library for Arduino that I wrote originally in 
2007 for  my book "Making Things Talk".  It's been refactored with a new API,
based on the Wire library API for Arduino 1.0, which David Mellis recently refactored.
It inherits from the Stream class so that it can use the write() and read() methods
from that class.

I haven't yet added read functionality, but if anyone wants to add that and send me
a pull request I'd be happy to see it.

To use it, you must be using Arduino 1.0 or later.
